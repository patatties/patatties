Hi, I’m patatties
I’m interested in cybersecurity subjects. I feel strong in networking architecture skills, confident in OS windows and linux (debian based pls :p), but lacking in a lot of programming subjects.
I’m currently learning Security Operations Center skills, not least of which SOC Analisys, SOC engineering, and ethical hacking (though primitively). This all covered in scripting sauce, which i hope to develop to programming.
